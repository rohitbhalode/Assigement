    "Ans : Log levels in Python logging provide a way to categorize log messages based on their severity or importance. Each log level represents a different level of detail or urgency, allowing developers to control the verbosity of logging output. \n",
    "\n",
    "1)DEBUG: This log level is used for detailed diagnostic information, typically useful during development and debugging phases. It provides the most detailed information about program execution, variable values, and function calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "2)INFO: The INFO log level is used to convey general information about the program's execution. It's useful for providing high-level updates or milestones during normal operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)WARNING: This log level indicates potentially harmful or unexpected situations that do not prevent the program from functioning but may require attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)ERROR: The ERROR log level is used to indicate errors that prevented the program from performing a specific operation or caused it to behave abnormally. \n",
    "\n",
    "5)CRITICAL: This log level represents the most severe level of logging. It is used to indicate critical errors or failures that may lead to the program's termination or significant loss of functionality. "
